# Section View Tracker v1.0

The Section View Tracking Script monitors Y axis scroll events to signal page section engagement.
Events listeners are set on sections that trigger when the section element is scrolled in view or out of view. 

This functionality can be used to trigger animated effects, or asynchronous data fetching. 

Events
- "onEngaged" : When a section is in view or 'engaged'
- "onUngaged" : When a section is moved out of view or 'disengaged'

On the index page, you'll see a pretty good example of what you can do with a simple implementation.

Hope this saves some time for someone =)
